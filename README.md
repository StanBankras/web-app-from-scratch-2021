# Coinevents - Web app from scratch

This project is my best attempt to build a modern web app from scratch, without any frameworks or big packages to do the hard work. It's totally new to me,
but I think going back to the roots is a good thing to learn how a framework really works.

## :sweet_potato: Coinpaprika API
I have chosen to work with the [Coinpaprika API](https://api.coinpaprika.com/). It's an API that has data of all live cryptocurrencies, ranked based on marketcap. The API is open, always free to use and very friendly to use. Using the API I can retrieve data per coin like on which exchanges it is listed, tweets related to the coin and upcoming events for the coin.

**Base URL**
The base URL of this API is `https://api.coinpaprika.com/v1/`.

**Endpoints used in this project**:
* `/coins` - Retrieve all coins listed on Coinpaprika as object with their corresponding coin-id
* `/coins/${id}/ohlcv/historical` - Retrieve day to day historical price data from a coin
* `/coins/${id}/markets` - Retrieve trading markets that are active for this coin
* `/coins/${id}/twitter` & `/coins/${id}/events` - Retrieve latest Tweets & events by this coin's project

**Rate limit**

Coinpaprika limits the amount of requests per IP to [10 per second](https://api.coinpaprika.com/#section/Rate-limit). Make sure to handle this when using the API.

## :pencil2: Concept
The concept is to make an alternative to [Coinpaprika](https://coinpaprika.com/) where I show upcoming events and most recent tweets of a project, instead of raw data. This could help a normal person to better understand what is about to happen to the project that is behind the coin.

## :rocket: Features
:heavy_check_mark: Most recent tweet of all top 20 cryptos

:heavy_check_mark: Most latest event of all top 20 cryptos

:heavy_check_mark: Monthly price chart per coin

:heavy_check_mark: Find out which pairs the coin is traded against and where
