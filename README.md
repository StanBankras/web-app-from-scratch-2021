# Web app from scratch

## [Live website](https://stanbankras.github.io/web-app-from-scratch-2021/)

## Description

but I think going back to the roots is a good thing to learn how a framework really works.

<!-- What external data source is featured in your project and what are its properties ðŸŒ  -->
