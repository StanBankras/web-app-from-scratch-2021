# Web app from scratch

## [Live website](https://stanbankras.github.io/web-app-from-scratch-2021/)

## Description
This project is my best attempt to build a modern web app from scratch, without any frameworks or big packages to do the hard work. It's totally new to me,
but I think going back to the roots is a good thing to learn how a framework really works.

## Chosen API
I have chosen to work with the [Coinpaprika API](https://api.coinpaprika.com/). It's an API that has data of all live cryptocurrencies, ranked based on marketcap. The API is open, always free to use and very friendly to use. Using the API I can retrieve data per coin like on which exchanges it is listed, tweets related to the coin and upcoming events for the coin.

## Concept
The concept is to make an alternative to [Coinpaprika](https://coinpaprika.com/) where I show upcoming events and most recent tweets of a project, instead of raw data. This could help a normal person to better understand what is about to happen to the project that is behind the coin.
